## About the project
This is a simple cellular automata simulator built with **Java Spring** and **JavaScript**. The user creates a custom two-dimensional grid filled with random cell states and specifies the depth (number of steps) they'd like to simulate, as well as the desired rules for the cellular automata. By default, the ruleset follows Conway's Game of Life.

*Note: Currently the simulator runs well on grids with a number of rows and columns of less than 35.*


## Reflection
The original purpose of this simulator was to recreate Conway's Game of Life in Java, a language taught in CS230 *Object-Oriented Programming* at the University of Auckland, as a small independent experiment in using OOP to simulate complex systems. Since then, it has grown into a full-stack web application with a JavaScript frontend, relying extensively on the p5.js library to draw the 2D grid, and a Java Spring backend. 

This is also the author's first exposure with Java Spring. Needless to say, a lot of trial-and-error and StackOverflow-ing were involved!
